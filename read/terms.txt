    the same scalar can hold different objects in different classes.

 A class within Perl is a package that contains the corresponding methods
 required to create and manipulate objects.

 A method within Perl is a subroutine, defined with the package.
  The first argument to the method is an object reference or a package name,
   depending on whether the method affects the current object or the class.

   A package is a self-contained unit of user-defined variables and subroutines, which can
    be re-used over and over again.
   Perl Packages provide a separate namespace within a Perl program which keeps subroutines and variables
    independent from conflicting with those in other packages.
